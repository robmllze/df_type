/// A queue for sequentially executing functions one at a time.
///
/// This class ensures that functions are executed in the order they are added,
/// with only one function running at a time. When a function is added using
/// the [add] method, it is placed at the end of the queue. The queue processes
/// each function sequentially, starting the next function only after the
/// current one has completed. The queue continues processing until it is empty.
///
/// The [add] method immediately schedules the function for execution, but it
/// does not execute it until all previously added functions have finished. This
/// allows for accurate control over the order and timing of function execution.
///
/// You can introduce a delay before a function executes by specifying a
/// `buffer` duration. This is useful for scenarios where you need to throttle
/// execution.

  /// immediately after all previously added functions have completed.

  /// If the [buffer] parameter is provided, the function is executed alongside
  /// a buffer duration. This ensures that the total execution time of the
  /// function is at least as long as the [buffer] duration, which can be useful
  /// for throttling operations and ensuring a minimum duration for each task.
  ///
  /// The method returns a [FutureOr] that completes when both the function and
  /// all preceding functions in the queue have completed. This means, when
